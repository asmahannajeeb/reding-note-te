# what we learned today :
# windows terminal
after we took generall information about windows terminal today we started working on it .
we took some commands which I found it very useful :
(li) which means list 
(pwd) which means print work directory 
(cd) which means change directory 
(mkdir) which means make directory , to create folder
(touch) to creat a file 
and the most important command is git which helps us connect github to windows terminal by using get with some commands such as :
* git clone
* git status 
* git add .
* git commit -m
* git push origin main 
* git pull origin main 

# HTML 
we took a review on what we learned and we took another command such as 
* meta 
* ul
* ol
* li
* p
* footer 
* header 
* section 
* artical
